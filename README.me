🧩 Problem Statement
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1], then return 0

🧾 Initial Attempt
The original code attempted to:

Convert the integer to a string.

Append each character to a stack (list).

Reverse the stack and remove trailing zero.

Print the result.

🧰 Data Structures Used

-- list (stack) - Used as a stack to hold the original characters of the number

-- stack1 - Intermediate list to copy digits (after checking negative sign)

-- stack2	- Reversed digits stored in this stack

⚙️ Key Techniques and Concepts
Handling signs using:

python code 
is_negative = False
if stack[0] == '-':
    is_negative = True
    stack.pop(0)
String manipulation: Converting int to string and back.

Stack simulation with lists: Reversing digits manually.

🚀 Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of digits in x.

Space Complexity: O(n) due to the use of multiple stacks (lists).
